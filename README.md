Hi there! I am Muntaqim Ahmed, a PhD student interested in Multimodal Machine Learning, Medical Imaging, LLMs/VLMs, Generative AI, and Time-Series.

My research centers on developing models that reason jointly over multiple modalities — including medical images, clinical text, and physiological time-series signals — with applications in healthcare. I am particularly interested in how multimodal architectures can be designed to improve performance, robustness, and fairness across diverse and clinically meaningful data sources.

For those who may be new to this area, multimodal machine learning studies how to integrate information from different data types.

To gain a foundational understanding of multimodal ML, I highly recommend the survey:
“A Comprehensive Survey of Multimodal Machine Learning” — https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.09406
